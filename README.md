# 4th-Year-Project

Software mapping version 1.0.1 has some minor bugs fixed and slightly improved gui. This version is stable and I did not 
encountered any issues with it. It successfully scans LAN network and listens for SSDP protocols. Once received it checks
if the IP address already exists, if not its being added to the XML file and to the map. File can also be saved on the
desktop using Ctrl+S command or by choosing Save.
